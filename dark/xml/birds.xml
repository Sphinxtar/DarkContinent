<bird>In a brilliant flash of blue and red a bird of paradise loudly flaps by.</bird>
<bird>A big black fly goes buzzing right by your ear making you swat and miss.</bird>
<bird>An enourmous dragon fly zig zags across with a loud whirrring sound.</bird>
<bird>A cloud of mosquitoes floats up from the bush as you push through.</bird>
<bird>Something noisily scurrys by in the undergrowth.</bird>
<bird>A huge bumblebee hovers in front of your face for a moment.</bird>
<bird>You disturb a swarm of flies as you step in elephant dung.</bird>
<bird>The smell of the rotting jungle floor overcomes you momentarily.</bird>
<bird>The smell makes you gag as you step in tiger dung.</bird>
<bird>You curse and swat wildly as you stumble into a cloud of gnats.</bird>
<bird>Locusts sing loudly in the trees nearby.</bird>
<bird>Chimps chatter loudly at you from the treetops.</bird>
<bird>A massive blue and yellow parrot squawks loudly as you rustle by.</bird>
<bird>An unseen toucan hoots softly overhead.</bird>
