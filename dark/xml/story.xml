   It's been a long flight all the way to darkest africa to fulfill your
destiny and embark on a safari in search of the lost temple of ganaysha.
The spirit of the elephant guards it legends say, but the fabulous diamond
amulet you picked up at an antique auction along with a tattered old map
and diary that came with it tell a different story, one of diamonds as
large as your fist littering the sacred ground of the temple.  You've
booked a trip and arranged for guides without divulging your destination
through an outfit of questionable reputation named Smythes Safari Tours,
the only guide in this part of the world.
   Your plane touches down at Kilomanjaro airport in the most terrifying
landing you've ever experienced, you'd kiss the ground when you disembark
except your lips would sizzle like a fresh steak on a too hot grill and
stick to the burning sahara sands in the heat hot enough to make a camel
faint.

   Walking weak kneed to the hangar across the makeshift runway, you
manage to smile when you see the old faded beer sign in the window of a
quonset hut hangar.  A large burly sort dressed in robes of the desert
nomads with an enourmous scimitar and a curved knife stuck in his belt
stands behind the bar.  He utters something in a foriegn language you
can't understand and nods...

You take a seat and:

        A) ask the gentlemen for a beer
        B) beg for a glass of water
        C) ask for the next flight home
        D) ask for Smythes Safari Tours

            The bartender grunts:

�2
   You point to the faded old beer sign and raise your hand in mock drink,
the bedouin barkeep reaches into a hole in the floor behind the bar and
comes up holding a brown bottle.  It looks tiny in his enourmous hand.
Muttering something again you can't understand he points to the old
fashioned bottle opener on the face of the bar and hands it to you. You
realize it's warm, but the heat is just as bad inside as out and at that
point you just don't give a damn.
�3
   SPLOOSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! The bottle explodes in a geyser of hot beer,
you manage to catch a few drops before you're left holding a bottle of
foam.  The barkeep laughs and bellows more of his strange foriegn chatter.
�4
   You barely get the word "water" from your lips and the bedouin
bartender shakes his head and points to a trough out back where a yak is
having a bath and the time of his life, a pipe on one end trickles
some brownish liquid that may turn into water after settling in the
trough for a couple of days, you wanderer over but you can't decide
which smells worse, the yak or the murky water, you spit it out and
and return to the bar.
�5
   He points at the plane you got off of and you turn around and head back
across the burning sand of the runway.  The plane is air conditioned
inside, the stewardess giving oxygen mask instructions in french and
swahili as you find your old seat and you notice they've emptied the trash
and given you a new sack of peanuts.  You drift off to sleep as the plane
lifts off and awake well on your way to civilization. You motion to the
stewardess for a drink but it's too late, you're landing right now and
she tells you to fasten your seat belt....
�6
   Someone taps you on the shoulder, "Harold Smythe here sir". a thick
british accent announces,  "Don't pay our host here any mind, he's
been trying to tell you there's been no ice through here in months
and the only fresh water is in the next village, bloke doesn't work here
anyway, the tourist season isn't for another 3 months". "Hope you had a
nice flight but I doubt it, the only reason I've been here for the last
fifteen years is because I wouldn't get back on that damn plane.  What
brings you here to the dark continent?", he rambled on, "Not saying eh?",
"They never do, it's always the same, chasing one legend or another."
�7
   "Two ways you can take it from here, either take that old plane at
the end of the runway, the WWII twin propeller refugee over there and
we'll enter on the other side at Nudi Ayubi or we can take a jeep into
the village and find some bearers and enter the jungle there, takes
a full day longer but it's safer."
              You:
                     A) chance it on the plane.
                     B) put your luggage in the jeep.
                     C) ask for another beer.

�8
   You find your luggage has been dumped on the runway from the plane you
arrived on and it's taxiing to take off at this very moment, "too late
now", you think to yourself, "there's no turning back".
�9
   Tossing in your bags and climbing into an old bomber that look's if
it's been parked here since world war two totally unused.  "This here's
your pilot", says Harold, "George Umbala, I'll meet you in Nudi Ayubi
tomorrow or so, I have to pick up your bearers, guides and supplies.
You'll be fairly comfortable at the hotel there and besides, I don't
trust this plane".  With a foolish grin and an uneasy feeling you wave
good bye and with a horrific shudder and demented groan the old plane
takes to the sky.  You settle back and try not to think about the way
the plane is shaking, still suffering from jet lag you manage to fall
into a dreamless asleep.
�10
   A violent lurch of the plane brings you awake and to your feet all at
once.  It takes you several seconds to realize where the hell you are
and only one second after that to realize what's happening as George is
turning white as a sheet and jabbering some sort of prayer in swahili.
You run to the cockpit, your heart stops as you see a mountain suddenly
looming up before you and George pulling back on the stick for all he's
worth.  Without a word you jump into the co-pilot seat and haul back on
the stick with everything you've got as the old plane sputters and
groans and the mountain draws ever closer. "WE'RE ON FIRE!, we'll never
make it!"  George screams in terror.  The flames roaring from the left
engine and spreading out across the whole wing urges you on to a deeper
strength and it seems as if you pull the plane over the mountain top on
sheer will alone, but not quite high enough.  The belly of the plane hits
the top of the mountain tearing the tail section completely off, sending
the remainder of the plane plummeting down the mountain's other side.
You see the forrest floor looming bright and green and then turning into
velvety blackness, you never even hear it crash.
�11
   The jeep is a rusted world war II relic that looks as if it didn't
make it back, windshield frosted white from sandstorms and folded down
so the driver can see.  A two hour drive through the desert and the
scenery changes all at once with the lush green jungle rising up like
cliffs before the flatness of the desert.  The road turns from flat
desert highway into deeply rutted four wheel drive trail as the jungle
folds around you blotting out even the setting sun.  Four hours of a
bucking bronco of a jeep ride that has your kidneys beaten and bruised
beyond use later, you arrive at the collection of mud huts that must
pass for a village in these parts and greatfully curl up on a soft
bed of palm fronds with a zebra skin blanket and plummet into a deep
slumber. It's been a hell of a day and tomorrow will be even stranger.
�12
   Abdul passes you another with similar results, between the bubbles
and the heat you're starting to feel kind of sick but you're no longer
thirsty.
�13
   You're awakened by the village drums, Smythe has your bearers
assembled to carry all your supplies in a lot of big bundles and
woven tea chests strung on poles between them, the smaller bundles
perched atop their heads and a guide to tote your gun for you.  "Hope
you're up to a good hike"  Smythe says to you, "we'll be into the thick
of it soon enough and it's all uncharted from there on".
�14
   You're Alive! is the first thought in your mind when you awaken an
unknown number of days later.  Gently testing your extremities one at a
time you take inventory, nothing broken but everything aching all over.
Still strapped into the cockpit or what's left of it you look over to
see your pilots body with a tree branch impaled in his chest and looking
at least two days old.  You unstrap yourself and swing out of the seat
only to realize too late the plane is stuck in a tree and fall ten feet
to the jungle floor.  The soft undergrowth cushions your fall, you pick
yourself up and despite everything else it feels so damn great to be alive
you give your best tarzan yell and take a look around and reach for the
one thing that lead you here, your diamond elephant shaped amulet is GONE,
probably thrown out of the plane along with everything else in the crash.

The bearers move at a quick march and the path takes you along cliffs who's
steep face means certain death and gazing out into the void you can see only
the tops of clouds a mile below with no sign of the jungle at the bottom.
You travel in silence for some 20 odd clicks when a large feathered dart
thuds into a nearby tree.  "Pygmies!" Smythe shouts and starts shooting into
the brush, the natives scream in terror and drop most of your supplies over
the cliff in their haste to turn back.  You unsling your rifle and prepare
to make a stand of it but another feathered dart sinks deep into your leg.
All goes fuzzy instantly as your head spins and you fall over the cliff!
�17
You awake with an incredibly bad curare' hangover from the darts poison
and realize you're not dead, you just feel like it. In a lucky break you
fell onto a narrow ledge some 8 feet below the trail on the face of the
steep cliff.  Clawing and grasping at roots sticking out of it's face you
make your way back up to the trail and discover you're all alone, your
bearers and guides fled or suffered worse fates at the hands of the
pygmies.  You can't tell which way along the cliff you came and plunge
into the jungle headlong to keep from being seen by more pygmies. Taking
a look around you see all your stuff scattered around but your elephant
shaped diamond amulet is GONE!

�21
You need a name to be known by the other bwana's in the game.
Please pick a handle suitable for this, you are striving to be
lord of the jungle in this so let's get in the spirit here!
�22
�23
With your belly distended from starvation and your tongue swollen from
thirst you collapse on the jungle floor unable to move another step and
finally black out completely, by some miracle still barely alive but
totally defenseless, your day has ended.
�24
You wake up to the chatter of the jungle birds more dead than alive,
still starving and dying from thirst your nap has regained you enough
strength for a move or two more, but not much if you don't find food
or water very soon.
�25
Your agony subsides and all fades to black as your life ends, leaving
no more than a greasy spot on the map as a tombstone and the squawk of
vultures gathering for the feast as an epitaph, your mortal remains
reduced to fertilizer and a hardy meal for the scavengers and insects.
�26
You collapse from heat and starvation unable to move and mercifully pass
out only to awaken a moment later as a large tiger begins chewing on your
leg, your throat so parched you can't even scream and so wracked with
hunger and exhaustion unable to move you pray for death but get no answer
as a large vulture who couldn't wait settles down on your head and plucks
out one eye, then the other before you slowly bleed to death.

Your day has run out as the blazing african sunset burns bright red and
the jungle grows cold you curl up in the warmth of a soft bed of rotting
leaves and drift off to sleep dreaming of civilization.
�34
You awake screaming from the most horrible dream of a violent and agonizing
death in a strange and terrifying place.  As you gather your wits about you
and look around you find the most horrible part of your dream wasn't a
dream at all!  You are completely lost on the dark continent with little or
no chance for survival unless you can learn to become one with the jungle,
scrounge enough food and water while conserving your strength and increasing
your level of jungle savvy to become this violent place's lord and master.
At your feet and directly behind you (south) you find a few items scattered
from your introduction to this horrid land.

shred of meat.
